# fullpage-fantasy-website

A fantasy themed site I've been working on with images I've found online. Most parts are made with CSS such as the buttons, sidebar navigation, etc. The themes change from light to dark depending on if the background is an image. And there are transitions between sections such as the wheel in the upper-left that rotates with the changes of the section. There's also a sections using the YouTube API to show search results in a sidebar.
